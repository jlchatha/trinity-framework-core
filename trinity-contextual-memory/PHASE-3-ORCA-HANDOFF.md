# Phase 3 ORCA Integration - Handoff Documentation

**Current Status**: Phase 2 Complete - Deep HISTORIAN domain expertise established  
**Next Phase**: ORCA MCP integration for Trinity-wide contextual memory access  
**Handoff Date**: TBD based on ORCA readiness  
**HISTORIAN Role**: Provide system architecture and context data for ORCA integration  

## System Ready for ORCA Integration

### Current Implementation Status
âœ… **Phase 1**: Manual context creation (22 entries)  
âœ… **Phase 2**: Ansible-powered query and extraction (functional)  
ðŸ”„ **Phase 3**: ORCA MCP integration (ready for handoff)

```

#### Query Interface (Ready)
```bash
# Current Ansible interface ORCA can build upon
ansible-playbook context-query.yml -e "query='[question]'"
# Returns: Best matching context with evidence and relationships

ansible-playbook context-extract-unit.yml -e "source_path='[path]'"  
# Returns: Extracted decisions for review and context creation
```

#### Response Format (Standardized)
```markdown
## [Context Title]

**Q: "[Why question]"**
**A:** [Evidence-based answer]

**Evidence:**
- [Concrete artifact]: [Specific detail]
- [Measurable outcome]: [Quantified result]

**[Agent]-Specific Insight:** [Domain expertise interpretation]

**Related Context:**
- [Link 1]: [Relationship description]
- [Link 2]: [Relationship description]
```

## ORCA Integration Requirements

### 1. MCP Protocol Design

#### Context Query Protocol
```typescript
// ORCA MCP server interface
interface ContextQuery {
  query: string;           // Natural language "why" question
  agent?: string;          // Optional agent filter (historian, analyst, etc.)
  stream?: string;         // Optional stream filter (technical, operational, etc.)
  depth?: number;          // Number of related contexts to include
}

interface ContextResponse {
  primary_context: ContextEntry;
  related_contexts: ContextEntry[];
  confidence_score: number;
  source_evidence: string[];
}
```

#### Context Creation Protocol  
```typescript
interface ContextCreation {
  source_path: string;     // Path to AAR or decision document
  agent: string;          // Agent responsible for this domain
  review_required: boolean; // Whether human review needed before publishing
}

interface ContextDraft {
  extracted_decisions: DecisionSummary[];
  suggested_contexts: ContextEntry[];
  pending_review_path: string;
}
```

### 2. Backend Integration Points

#### File System Bridge
```python
# ORCA should interface with existing file structure
class ContextualMemoryBackend:
    def query_contexts(self, query: str, filters: dict) -> list:
        # Use existing Ansible playbook or replicate scoring logic
        pass
    
    def extract_decisions(self, source_path: str) -> list:
        # Use existing extraction logic
        pass
    
    def create_context(self, context_data: dict) -> str:
        # Create markdown file following template
        pass
```

#### Relationship Management
```python
class RelationshipMapper:
    def find_related_contexts(self, context_id: str) -> list:
        # Parse "Related Context" sections
        pass
    
    def suggest_relationships(self, new_context: dict) -> list:
        # Analyze content similarity and decision inheritance
        pass
    
    def update_index(self, new_context: str) -> None:
        # Maintain INDEX.md automatically
        pass
```

### 3. Agent Interface Design

#### For Trinity Agents
```python
# ORCA provides this interface to other agents
async def ask_why(question: str, agent_context: str = None) -> str:
    """
    Ask a "why" question and get evidence-based answer
    Returns: Formatted response with evidence and related contexts
    """
    
async def capture_decision(decision_data: dict) -> None:
    """
    Capture a decision for future context creation
    Auto-extracts from agent's current work session
    """
    
async def get_agent_principles(agent_name: str) -> dict:
    """
    Retrieve documented principles for specific agent
    Returns: Agent's documented decision-making patterns
    """
```

#### For External Systems
```python
# MCP server endpoints ORCA should provide
@mcp_endpoint("contextual_memory/query")
async def handle_context_query(params: ContextQuery) -> ContextResponse:
    """Handle natural language context queries"""
    
@mcp_endpoint("contextual_memory/extract")
async def handle_decision_extraction(params: ContextCreation) -> ContextDraft:
    """Extract decisions from source documents"""
    
@mcp_endpoint("contextual_memory/agents")
async def get_agent_expertise() -> dict:
    """Return map of agent domains and expertise areas"""
```

## HISTORIAN's Handoff Responsibilities

### 1. System Documentation for ORCA
- [x] Complete architecture documentation (this document)
- [x] Query interface specification
- [x] Data format standards
- [x] Evidence quality requirements
- [x] Agent domain patterns

### 2. Training Data Preparation
```bash
# HISTORIAN will provide ORCA with:
# 1. Complete working system for analysis
# 2. 22 high-quality context entries as examples
# 3. Decision tree mapping methodology
# 4. Relationship mapping patterns
# 5. Evidence validation criteria
```

### 3. Integration Testing Support

- Ensure context quality maintained through ORCA interface
- Test agent-specific query accuracy
- Verify relationship mapping preservation

### 4. Transition Planning
```yaml
transition_phases:
  phase_3a: "ORCA builds MCP server with existing backend"
  phase_3b: "ORCA enhances query algorithms and relationship detection"
  phase_3c: "ORCA provides agent interfaces for other Trinity agents"
  phase_3d: "Full ORCA management with HISTORIAN as domain consultant"
```

## Success Criteria for ORCA Integration

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] MCP server provides sub-second responses for context queries
- [ ] Query accuracy maintains 100% for HISTORIAN domain questions
- [ ] Context creation preserves evidence quality standards
- [ ] Relationship mapping automatically maintained
- [ ] Agent-specific filtering works correctly

### Operational Requirements  
- [ ] Other Trinity agents can query contextual memory via ORCA
- [ ] Decision extraction works from any agent's AAR sessions
- [ ] Context creation workflow streamlined for non-HISTORIAN agents
- [ ] System self-maintains INDEX.md and relationship mappings
- [ ] Knowledge capture becomes automatic rather than manual

### Knowledge Quality Requirements
- [ ] No degradation in context evidence quality
- [ ] Agent domain expertise preserved through transition
- [ ] Decision inheritance chains maintained
- [ ] Cross-agent relationship mapping enhanced
- [ ] Trinity-wide pattern library continues growing

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Preservation
- Current file-based system remains as backup
- All context entries version-controlled in git
- ORCA integration additive, not replacement
- HISTORIAN retains ability to manually create contexts

### Quality Control
- Evidence requirements enforced at ORCA level
- Human review process for agent-generated contexts
- Quality metrics monitoring for context accuracy
- Fallback to manual process if ORCA quality degrades

### Domain Expertise Protection
- HISTORIAN remains authoritative for documentation domain
- Agent specialization patterns preserved in ORCA design
- Deep domain focus maintained over broad coverage
- HISTORIAN consultation required for major system changes

## ORCA Development Priorities

### Priority 1: Core MCP Server

- Maintain existing context quality and accuracy

### Priority 2: Agent Integration
- Create interfaces for other Trinity agents to query contexts
- Implement decision extraction from any agent's workspace
- Build streamlined context creation workflow

### Priority 3: Enhanced Intelligence
- Improve relationship detection algorithms
- Add automatic cross-agent pattern recognition
- Implement predictive context suggestions

### Priority 4: Autonomous Operation
- Self-maintaining index and relationship systems
- Automatic quality monitoring and improvement
- Proactive context extraction from agent activities
