## Trinity Architecture Patterns

**Q: "What consistent patterns emerge in Trinity's technical decisions?"**

**A:** Trinity consistently chooses simple, proven solutions over complex, perfect ones. The pattern: file systems over databases, markdown over rich formats, shell scripts over frameworks, and buffers over optimization.

**Evidence:**
- Protocol Files: Markdown over database storage
- Contextual Memory: File system over database queries  
- Infrastructure: Generous buffers over tight optimization
- Development: Time constraints over endless perfection
- Naming: Practical duality over pure consistency

**Key Insight:** Trinity's architecture philosophy prioritizes shipping functional solutions over engineering perfection, consistently choosing operational simplicity.
