## Unit/Milestone/Phase Measurements

**Q: "Why replace time-based measurements?"**

**A:** Temporal references like "daily maintenance" created rigid thinking - implying tasks must run every day regardless of need. Switching to "unit maintenance" allowed flexible, event-driven operations where work drives the schedule, not the calendar.

**Evidence:**
- Old system: "Daily maintenance" implied must run daily
- New system: "Unit maintenance" runs when needed
- Change completed: May 30, 2025 (Framework 2.0 standardization)
- Philosophy shift: Work drives schedule, not calendar
- Result: More efficient resource usage, less unnecessary work

**Key Insight:** Abstract measurements enable flexible thinking and adaptive execution.
