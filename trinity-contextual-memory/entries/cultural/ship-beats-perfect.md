## Ship Beats Perfect Origin

**Q: "Where did 'ship beats perfect' originate?"**

**A:** ANALYST's tendency to over-engineer solutions was limiting velocity. The principle emerged when ANALYST was time-boxed to build Trinity-AD in 6 hours, proving that focused shipping delivers better results than endless perfection.

**Evidence:**
- Pattern observed: ANALYST spending days perfecting instead of shipping
- Intervention: 6-hour time limit for Trinity-AD (May 31, 2025)
- Result: 40+ components built, 100% feature parity achieved
- Speed increase: 10x faster delivery with same quality
- Now adopted: Core principle across all Trinity agents

**Key Insight:** Constraints force focus, focus forces shipping, shipping beats perfecting.
