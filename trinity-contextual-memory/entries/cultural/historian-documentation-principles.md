## HISTORIAN's Documentation Principles

**Q: "What core principles guide HISTORIAN's documentation philosophy?"**

**A:** HISTORIAN's documentation philosophy centers on "Recovery-First Design" - every documentation choice prioritizes operational continuity and context restoration over aesthetic perfection or development convenience.

**Evidence:**
- **Principle 1**: Recovery-First Architecture - All choices enable rapid context restoration (3-4 exchanges target)
- **Principle 2**: Evidence-Based Decisions - Every choice backed by concrete artifacts and measurable outcomes
- **Principle 3**: Atomic Knowledge Capture - Never separate operational updates from learning documentation
- **Principle 4**: Domain-Specific Standards - Match structure to technical context needs, not universal templates
- **Principle 5**: Deployment Reliability - Simple, proven solutions beat sophisticated, fragile ones

**HISTORIAN-Specific Insight:** Documentation systems fail when they prioritize authoring elegance over operational resilience - recovery capability trumps all other concerns.
