# Checkpoint System Recovery-First Design

**Date**: April-June 2025  
**Decision**: Implement file-based checkpoint system for all recovery scenarios  
**Status**: Implemented and Proven  

## Context

**Q: "Why does Trinity use file-based checkpoints instead of in-memory or database state?"**

**A:** File-based checkpoints were chosen after database connections achieved 0% survival rate during process crashes while files had 100% survival. The system prioritizes recovery reliability over performance, using human-readable JSON files that can be manually recovered if automation fails. This aligns with Trinity's Recovery-First Design principle where operational continuity trumps all other concerns.

## Evidence

From Framework 2.0 documentation:
- "Recovery success improved from ~60% to 100% with checkpoint system"
- "April 2025 auto-compact recovery: files survived, database connections didn't"

From checkpoint-manager.js implementation:
```json
{
  "id": "ckpt_20250626_123456",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-26T12:34:56Z",
  "utilization": 75,
  "tokens": { "used": 150000, "limit": 200000 }
}
```

From beta architecture: "Checkpoint system for resilient installation"

## Impact

- **Recovery Rate**: Improved from 60% to 100% success
- **Process Crashes**: Survived when databases failed
- **Manual Recovery**: Possible with simple text editor
- **Zero Dependencies**: Works without running services
- **Transparency**: Human-readable for debugging

## Validation

Checkpoint system validated through:
1. 100% recovery success rate across all agents
2. Manual recovery saving multiple critical sessions
3. Corruption recovery with text editor intervention
4. Zero failures from missing database connections
