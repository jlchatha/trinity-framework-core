# FieldGearCrawler Infrastructure as Code Pattern

**Date**: May 2025  
**Decision**: Use CloudFormation templates for entire infrastructure  
**Status**: Implemented and Proven  

## Context

**Q: "Why did FieldGearCrawler use CloudFormation instead of manual AWS setup?"**

**A:** Infrastructure as Code via CloudFormation was chosen to ensure reproducible deployments, enable version control for infrastructure changes, and support multiple environments. The nested stack approach with separate templates for backend, frontend, Cognito, and API integration provided modular infrastructure management that could be tested, reviewed, and rolled back like application code.

## Evidence

From fieldgearcrawler/infrastructure/:
```yaml
# Nested stack structure
main-stack.yaml
├── backend-stack.yaml      # DynamoDB, Lambda functions
├── frontend-stack.yaml     # Amplify hosting
├── cognito-stack.yaml      # Authentication
└── api-stack.yaml          # API Gateway integration
```

Template patterns:
- Parameters for environment-specific values
- Outputs for cross-stack references
- Conditions for optional resources
- Mappings for region-specific configs

## Impact

- **Reproducibility**: Identical infrastructure across environments
- **Version Control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in git
- **Review Process**: Infrastructure changes reviewed like code
- **Rollback**: Easy reversion of infrastructure changes
- **Documentation**: Templates serve as living documentation

## Related Context

- [Protocol Files Choice](protocol-files-choice.md) - Code as documentation
- [FieldGearCrawler Serverless Architecture](fieldgearcrawler-serverless-architecture.md) - Stack design
- [Denormalized Database Design](denormalized-database-design-choice.md) - Similar philosophy

## Validation

Infrastructure as Code approach validated when:
1. Dev environment recreated in 10 minutes after deletion
2. Production rollback completed successfully via git revert
3. Infrastructure audit passed by reviewing templates
4. New team member deployed complete stack independently
