# Beta Status Token-Based Architecture

**Date**: June 2025  
**Decision**: Use client-side token validation for beta status page  
**Status**: Proposed Design  

## Context

**Q: "Why use token-based URLs instead of server-side authentication for beta status?"**

**A:** Token-based status URLs with client-side validation were proposed to eliminate server dependencies while maintaining security. Each beta tester receives a unique URL containing an encrypted token in their welcome email. The status page decrypts the token using client-side JavaScript, displaying personalized information without any backend calls. This serverless approach aligns with Trinity's philosophy of simple, resilient solutions.

## Evidence

From beta-management-proposal.md Option 2:
```
1. HISTORIAN includes unique status URL in welcome email
2. URL contains encrypted token specific to that tester
3. Status page decrypts token client-side
4. Shows personalized status information

Technical Implementation:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages
- Client-side token validation (no server needed)
- HISTORIAN generates tokens when creating welcome emails
```

## Impact

- **Simplicity**: No backend servers or APIs required
- **Cost**: Zero ongoing infrastructure costs
- **Privacy**: No server logs of status checks
- **Resilience**: Works even if backend services fail
- **Performance**: Instant status display, no API calls

## Technical Approach

Token design pattern:
1. Generate JWT with tester email and status
2. Encrypt with shared secret
3. Include in personalized URL
4. Client-side JS decrypts and validates
5. Display status without server contact
