# Multi-Agent Handoff Implementation Design

**Date**: June 2025  
**Decision**: Implement file-based JSON handoffs between agents  
**Status**: Planned for Phase 3  

## Context

**Q: "Why does Trinity use file-based JSON handoffs instead of direct agent-to-agent communication?"**

**A:** File-based JSON handoffs were designed to maintain agent isolation while enabling collaboration. Each agent has a dedicated handoff directory where other agents can place context transfer files. This approach preserves Framework 2.0's operational autonomy principle while allowing structured information exchange. The asynchronous, file-based design prevents tight coupling between agents and creates an audit trail of all handoffs.

## Evidence

From future-development.md multi-agent framework:
```javascript
createHandoff(fromAgent, toAgent, context) {
  const handoffFile = `${workspaces[toAgent]}/handoff/${fromAgent}-${timestamp}.json`;
  
  const handoffData = {
    from: fromAgent,
    to: toAgent,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    context: context,
    status: 'pending'
  };
  
  fs.writeFileSync(handoffFile, JSON.stringify(handoffData, null, 2));
}
```

Design features:
- Handoff directories in each agent workspace
- JSON format for structured data
- Status tracking (pending/accepted)
- Timestamp-based naming for ordering

## Impact

- **Isolation**: Agents remain operationally independent
- **Auditability**: All handoffs leave permanent record
- **Flexibility**: Async processing, no blocking
- **Debuggability**: Human-readable JSON files
- **Recovery**: Handoffs survive agent restarts

- [Multi-Agent Collaboration Design](../strategic/multi-agent-collaboration-design.md) - Overall framework
- [Protocol Files Choice](protocol-files-choice.md) - File-based philosophy
- [Checkpoint File-Based Storage](../operational/checkpoint-file-based-storage.md) - Similar approach

## Implementation Pattern

Handoff workflow:
1. Source agent creates handoff JSON in target's directory
2. Target agent polls for pending handoffs
3. Target accepts handoff, updates status
4. Both agents maintain handoff history
5. Human can inspect/intervene if needed
