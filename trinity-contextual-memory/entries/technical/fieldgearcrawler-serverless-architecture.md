# FieldGearCrawler Serverless Architecture Decision

**Date**: May 2025  
**Decision**: Build complete e-commerce platform on serverless AWS stack  
**Status**: Implemented and Operational  

## Context

**Q: "Why did FieldGearCrawler choose serverless architecture over traditional servers?"**

**A:** Serverless architecture (Lambda + DynamoDB + API Gateway + Amplify) was chosen to minimize operational overhead, reduce costs to near-zero when idle, and provide automatic scaling for traffic spikes. This decision aligned with building a maintainable e-commerce platform that could handle variable traffic without dedicated DevOps resources or fixed server costs.

## Evidence

From fieldgearcrawler infrastructure:
- CloudFormation templates defining complete serverless stack
- Lambda functions for all backend logic
- DynamoDB for flexible NoSQL storage
- API Gateway with Cognito authorizers
- Static frontend on Amplify

From AAR documentation:
- "Cost optimization through serverless"
- "Automatic scaling eliminates capacity planning"
- "No server maintenance required"

## Impact

- **Cost**: Near-zero costs when no traffic
- **Scalability**: Handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Maintenance**: No server patching or updates
- **Development**: Focus on business logic, not infrastructure
- **Reliability**: AWS manages availability and redundancy

## Related Context

- [Zero-Cost Monitoring Design](../operational/fieldgearcrawler-zero-cost-monitoring.md) - Cost philosophy
- [Infrastructure as Code Pattern](fieldgearcrawler-infrastructure-as-code.md) - Deployment approach
- [Static Export Challenges](../operational/fieldgearcrawler-static-export-lessons.md) - Frontend decisions

## Validation

Serverless approach validated by:
1. Monthly AWS bills under $5 during development
2. Handled Black Friday traffic spike without intervention
3. Zero downtime from server maintenance
4. Rapid feature deployment without infrastructure changes
