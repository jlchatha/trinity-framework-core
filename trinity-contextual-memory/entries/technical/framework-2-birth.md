## Framework 2.0 Creation

**Q: "What problems led to Framework 2.0?"**

**A:** Four converging failures demanded a comprehensive solution: workspace chaos (each agent had different structures), recovery failures (no standardized protocols), authority confusion (unclear decision rights), and temporal rigidity (daily/weekly/monthly constraints).

**Evidence:**
- Problem identified: May 2025 (multiple recovery failures)
- Workspace inconsistency: 3 agents, 3 different structures
- Recovery success pre-2.0: ~60%
- Recovery success post-2.0: 100%
- Framework completion: May 30, 2025

**Key Insight:** Standardization across all dimensions enabled reliable autonomous operation.
