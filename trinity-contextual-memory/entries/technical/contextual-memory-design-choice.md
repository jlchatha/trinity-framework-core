## The Contextual Memory Design Choice

**Q: "Why use markdown files instead of a database for contextual memory?"**

**A:** Simple markdown files with grep/shell operations outperformed complex database approaches for Trinity's contextual memory needs. The system prioritizes quick answers over complex queries, making file-based storage optimal.

**Evidence:**
- Implementation time: 4 hours for complete system vs estimated weeks for database
- Query performance: Instant grep results vs database setup overhead
- Maintenance: Zero dependencies vs database administration burden
- Accessibility: Direct file editing vs database interface complexity
- Backup: Git handles versioning vs separate database backup systems

**Key Insight:** When your primary use case is "answer why questions quickly," file systems beat databases for simplicity and speed.
