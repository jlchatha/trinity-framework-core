# Beta AWS Workspace Architecture Choice

**Date**: May 2025  
**Decision**: Use AWS Workspaces with RHEL 8 for beta testing environment  
**Status**: Implemented  

## Context

**Q: "Why did Trinity choose AWS Workspaces for the beta testing environment?"**

**A:** AWS Workspaces with RHEL 8 was chosen to provide a controlled, standardized environment that could be consistently replicated for all beta testers. This decision solved multiple challenges: ensuring consistent Claude Code compatibility, providing enterprise-grade security, enabling rapid provisioning for new testers, and maintaining cost control through pay-per-use pricing.

## Evidence

From apex-beta-dev/architecture/system-architecture.md:
- "AWS Workspaces with RHEL 8 to provide a controlled, standardized environment"
- Framework 2.0 principles require "Workspace Standardization" and "Operational Autonomy"
- Checkpoint system implemented for resilient installation across interruptions

## Impact

- **Consistency**: Every beta tester gets identical environment
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade AWS security and isolation
- **Scalability**: Easy to provision new workspaces on demand
- **Cost Control**: Pay only for active testing hours
- **Recovery**: Built-in checkpoint system for installation resilience

## Related Context

- [Framework 2.0 Creation](framework-2-birth.md) - Workspace standardization principle
- [Protocol Files Choice](protocol-files-choice.md) - Standardized recovery approach
- [Beta Repository Separation](../strategic/beta-repository-separation.md) - Public/private split

## Decision Validation

Beta testing revealed this was the right choice when:
1. Multiple testers could be onboarded in parallel
2. Environment differences were eliminated as a variable
3. Security requirements were met without compromise
4. Cost remained predictable and manageable
