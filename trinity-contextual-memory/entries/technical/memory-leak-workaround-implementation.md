# Memory Leak Workaround Implementation

**Entry ID**: tech-memory-leak-workaround  
**Stream**: Technical  
**Date**: 2025-06-26  
**Evidence**: /tools/memory-leak-fix.js  

## Context Question
Why did HISTORIAN implement a memory leak fix for Claude Code's AbortSignal listeners?

## Decision Context
Claude Code environment was experiencing MaxListenersExceededWarning when using the context tracking system, indicating a memory leak in EventTarget listener management.

## Implementation Evidence
From memory-leak-fix.js:
```javascript
// Increase default max listeners to handle Claude Code's abort signal usage
// Default is 10, increasing to 50 to accommodate multiple concurrent operations
events.EventTarget.defaultMaxListeners = 50;
```

## Technical Approach
- **Root Cause**: Claude Code's AbortSignal implementation creates multiple listeners beyond Node.js default limit (10)
- **Solution**: Pragmatic increase to 50 listeners instead of complex listener cleanup
- **Scope**: Applied to both EventTarget and EventEmitter for comprehensive coverage
- **Framework Integration**: Designed for Trinity Framework 2.0 startup sequence

## Design Philosophy Revealed
This fix demonstrates HISTORIAN's pragmatic approach to technical problems:
1. **Simple over Complex**: Increased limits rather than implementing complex listener cleanup
2. **Environment-Specific**: Targeted specifically at Claude Code operational environment
3. **Preventive**: Applied at startup to prevent warnings during operation
4. **Documented Reasoning**: Clear comments explaining the "why" behind the numbers

## Operational Impact
- Eliminates MaxListenersExceededWarning during context tracking operations
- Enables reliable operation of Trinity Framework 2.0 context management
- Demonstrates adaptation to Claude Code's specific technical constraints

## Related Contexts
- Context tracking system implementation (tech-context-tracking-evolution)
- Trinity Framework 2.0 startup sequence
- Operational monitoring approach

## Pattern
This represents HISTORIAN's preference for pragmatic technical solutions that solve immediate operational problems while maintaining system reliability.
