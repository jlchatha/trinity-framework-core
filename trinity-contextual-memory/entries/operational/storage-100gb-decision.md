## The 100GB Storage Decision

**Q: "Why provision 100GB when 30GB might work?"**

**A:** OVERSEER's infrastructure analysis showed that while 30GB could technically work, it would cause constant storage anxiety. The breakdown: 50GB for user environments, 15GB for system/K8s, 15GB for operations, and 20GB buffer prevented any storage-related productivity loss.

**Evidence:**
- User environments: 50GB requirement
- System & Kubernetes: 15GB requirement  
- Operations workspace: 15GB requirement
- Safety buffer: 20GB
- Beta 2 storage issues: Zero (validation of decision)
- OVERSEER's principle: "Storage anxiety kills productivity"

**Key Insight:** Generous buffers prevent problems cheaper than solving them later.
