## HISTORIAN's AAR System Design

**Q: "Why create a two-tier AAR system instead of single-level documentation?"**

**A:** HISTORIAN designed Session AARs (20-50 lines) for routine context preservation and Incident AARs (comprehensive) for major analysis, creating scalable knowledge preservation that matches the urgency and depth of different situations.

**Evidence:**
- Two-tier structure: Sessions for routine work, Incidents for major issues
- Size differentiation: 20-50 lines vs comprehensive analysis
- Purpose separation: Context preservation vs knowledge transfer
- Recovery enhancement: Detailed recovery resources for different scenarios
- Naming standardization: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` for predictable access

**HISTORIAN-Specific Insight:** Knowledge preservation systems must scale to the importance of the event - routine sessions need lightweight capture, major incidents need deep analysis.
