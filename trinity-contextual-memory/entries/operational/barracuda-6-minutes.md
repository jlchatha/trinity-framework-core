## Barracuda Speed Record

**Q: "How did ANALYST build Barracuda in 6 MINUTES?"**

**A:** Given extreme constraints (solve Claude Projects file sync with THREE buttons in 4.5 hours), ANALYST entered "Focused Execution Mode" - no architecture debates, no feature planning, just build THE ONE THING. Result: fully functional tool in 6 minutes.

**Evidence:**
- Start time: 18:22 UTC (June 24, 2025)
- End time: 18:28 UTC (6 minutes total)
- Features delivered: Exactly 3 (Clean & Sync, Show Changes, Open Folder)
- Lines of code: ~200 (mostly boilerplate)
- Feature creep: ZERO
- Speed multiplier: 45x faster than normal development

**Key Insight:** Extreme constraints + clear mission = 45x faster delivery.
