## HISTORIAN's Documentation Standards Approach

**Q: "Why establish project-specific documentation standards instead of universal templates?"**

**A:** HISTORIAN creates tailored documentation standards for each project domain (like FieldGearCrawler Order Management) because different technical contexts require different documentation structures - API docs need different organization than infrastructure guides.

**Evidence:**
- Project-specific standards: ORDER-MANAGEMENT-DOCUMENTATION-STANDARDS.md for FieldGearCrawler
- Domain-specific categories: Technical, API, Architecture, Operational for order management
- Format requirements: SVG/PNG diagrams with source preservation for technical accuracy
- Context-aware structure: "Clear labeling of all components and interactions"
- Framework compliance: "Trinity Framework 2.0" standards with project adaptation

**HISTORIAN-Specific Insight:** Documentation effectiveness comes from matching structure to domain needs rather than forcing universal templates on diverse technical contexts.
