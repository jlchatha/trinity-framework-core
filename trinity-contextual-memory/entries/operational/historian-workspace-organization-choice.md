## HISTORIAN's Workspace Organization Choice

**Q: "Why organize workspaces with root directory constraints and predictable locations?"**

**A:** HISTORIAN designed workspace organization around recovery efficiency and context resilience, limiting root directories to 10 files maximum and placing critical recovery files at predictable locations for rapid auto-compact recovery.

**Evidence:**
- Design principle: "Recovery Prioritization: Most important recovery files at the root level"
- Root constraint: Maximum 10 files prevents navigation confusion during emergency recovery
- Predictable locations: AGENT.md, STATUS.md, AUTO-COMPACT.md always in root for immediate access
- Access efficiency: "Frequently accessed files in easily accessible locations"
- Recovery target: 3-4 exchanges to full operational awareness

**HISTORIAN-Specific Insight:** Documentation architecture prioritizes operational continuity over perfect organization - recovery speed trumps aesthetic filing.
