## HISTORIAN's STATUS + AAR Workflow Evolution

**Q: "Why pair STATUS.md updates with AAR creation instead of separate workflows?"**

**A:** HISTORIAN evolved a paired workflow where STATUS.md updates are immediately followed by AAR session creation, ensuring progress tracking and knowledge capture happen atomically rather than becoming disconnected activities.

**Evidence:**
- Paired commits: "Update STATUS.md and add AAR for HTML documentation fixes" (da0784a)
- Consistent pattern: "Update STATUS.md and add AAR for GitHub Pages deployment" (54fd983)
- Atomic workflow: Status updates trigger immediate knowledge capture
- Knowledge preservation: Each significant change gets both progress record and context documentation
- Session-based learning: AARs created for specific implementation sessions

**HISTORIAN-Specific Insight:** Knowledge systems fail when capture is optional - pairing operational updates with learning documentation ensures institutional memory actually gets preserved.
