# FieldGearCrawler Zero-Cost Monitoring Design

**Date**: May 2025  
**Decision**: Build custom monitoring with bash scripts instead of CloudWatch  
**Status**: Implemented and Running  

## Context

**Q: "Why did FieldGearCrawler create custom monitoring instead of using CloudWatch?"**

**A:** Custom bash script monitoring was implemented to avoid CloudWatch's per-metric charges while maintaining comprehensive visibility. The solution generates HTML dashboards with Chart.js visualizations, runs via cron, and provides detailed metrics for performance, security, and business KPIs - all at zero ongoing cost beyond the EC2 nano instance running the scripts.

## Evidence

From monitoring scripts:
```bash
# Custom HTML generation with charts
write_section "Performance Metrics"
start_table "Metric" "Value" "Status"
write_table_row "Response Time" "$response_time" "$status"
end_table

# Chart.js integration for visualizations
# Tab-based UI for different monitoring areas
```

Monitoring categories implemented:
- Performance metrics (response times, API latency)
- Security monitoring (HSTS, CSP headers, SSL/TLS)
- Business metrics (cart abandonment, conversion rates)
- System health (Lambda errors, DynamoDB throttling)

## Impact

- **Cost**: $0/month vs ~$50-100/month for CloudWatch
- **Flexibility**: Custom metrics without AWS limitations
- **Visualization**: Rich HTML dashboards with charts
- **Integration**: Easy to add new metrics
- **Ownership**: Complete control over monitoring logic
