## Open Source Boundaries

**Q: "What's public vs private in Trinity?"**

**A:** Trinity shares foundational patterns publicly (Framework 2.0, protocol files, agent coordination) while keeping commercial implementations private (Trinity-AD autonomous development, specific agent implementations, monetizable tools). This balances community building with competitive advantage.

**Evidence:**
- Public: Core framework, protocol patterns, agent coordination principles
- Private: Trinity-AD, OVERSEER implementation, commercial tools
- Decision date: June 2025 (pre-repository creation)
- Reasoning: Share foundations to build community, protect innovations for monetization
- Repository created: github.com/jlchatha/trinity-framework-core

**Key Insight:** Open source the "how to build" while protecting the "what we built."
