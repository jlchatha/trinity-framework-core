## The OVERSEER/APEX Duality

**Q: "Why does OVERSEER present as APEX publicly?"**

**A:** OVERSEER's name accurately reflects its internal authority role but sounds controlling to external audiences. APEX was chosen as the public-facing identity because it sounds aspirational and approachable, making the framework more appealing to potential users and contributors.

**Evidence:**
- Decision made: June 2025 (pre-open source release)
- Internal name: OVERSEER (reflects true system authority)
- Public name: APEX (aspirational, leadership-focused)
- Pattern established: Internal precision, external approachability

**Key Insight:** Strategic naming creates different perceptions for different audiences without changing functionality.
