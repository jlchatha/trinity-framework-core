# Beta Phased Rollout Strategy Design

**Date**: June 2025  
**Decision**: Four-phase rollout over 2+ months with clear checkpoints  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Active  

## Context

**Q: "Why does Trinity beta use a four-phase rollout instead of continuous deployment?"**

**A:** The four-phase rollout strategy (Initial → Enhanced → Advanced → Production) was designed to validate each layer of functionality before adding complexity. Each phase has explicit checkpoints requiring human evaluation of beta tester feedback before proceeding. This approach prevents feature creep, ensures solid foundations, and allows course correction based on real usage patterns rather than assumptions.

## Evidence

From future-development.md timeline:
```
Phase 1: Initial Beta (Current) - Basic functionality
Phase 2: Enhanced Beta (2 weeks) - Communication & testing
Phase 3: Advanced Beta (4-6 weeks) - Multi-agent & cloud
Phase 4: Production Prep (2 months) - Security & scale
```

Checkpoint requirements:
- Phase 2: "Confirm beta tester feedback on initial environment"
- Phase 3: "Evaluate beta tester usage patterns"
- Phase 4: "Review all beta feedback comprehensively"

## Impact

- **Quality**: Each phase thoroughly validated before next
- **Flexibility**: Can adjust based on feedback
- **Risk Reduction**: Problems caught early in simpler phases
- **User Focus**: Real usage drives priority decisions
- **Clear Milestones**: Beta testers know what's coming

- [Unit Not Daily Measurements](../cultural/unit-not-daily.md) - Non-temporal planning
- [Ship Beats Perfect Origin](../cultural/ship-beats-perfect.md) - Iterative delivery

## Phase Characteristics

1. **Phase 1**: Prove core works (workspace, agents, Claude)
2. **Phase 2**: Add essential tools (testing, monitoring)
3. **Phase 3**: Enable advanced features (multi-agent)
4. **Phase 4**: Production hardening (security, scale)

Each phase builds on proven foundation from previous.
