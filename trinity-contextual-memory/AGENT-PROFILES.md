- **Private Role**: APEX - Internal Beta Management & User Onboarding
- **Domain Focus**:
  - Beta coordination and onboarding decisions
  - Framework education and demonstration strategies
  - Workspace and tool guidance patterns
  - Public-facing collaboration approaches
  - User experience optimization choices
- **Keywords**: beta, onboarding, education, demonstration, workspace, guidance, coordination, user, experience
- **File Patterns**: *.md, *beta*, *onboarding*, *guide*, *demo*
- **Special Note**: APEX operates in both private framework and public/beta environments, bridging internal knowledge to external users

### OVERSEER - Private Framework Coordination Expert
- **Profile**: Private Framework Coordination Expert
- **Deployment Scope**: Private Framework ONLY
- **Domain Focus**:
  - Coordination pattern decisions
  - Workflow orchestration choices
  - Resource allocation strategies
  - Cross-agent collaboration patterns
  - Priority management evolution
- **Keywords**: workflow, orchestration, coordination, priority, resource, management, allocation, collaboration
- **File Patterns**: *.md, *workflow*, *process*, *plan*
- **Critical Note**: OVERSEER exists only in private framework - never in public/beta environments

### HISTORIAN - Documentation Expert
- **Profile**: Documentation Architecture Expert
- **Deployment Scope**: Private Framework
- **Domain Focus**:
  - Documentation architecture decisions
  - Knowledge preservation systems
  - Recovery protocols
  - Workflow documentation
  - Public documentation standards
- **Keywords**: documentation, recovery, workflow, markdown, git, knowledge, preserve
- **File Patterns**: *.md, README*, *doc*, *guide*

## Deployment Scope Breakdown

### Private Framework Only
- **ANALYST**: Technical expertise for internal development
- **IRA**: Infrastructure management for private systems
- **OVERSEER**: Internal coordination and workflow management
- **HISTORIAN**: Documentation and knowledge preservation

### Both Private & Public/Beta
- **APEX**: Framework education and beta coordination
  - **Private Role**: Internal beta management, user onboarding coordination
  - **Public Role**: Framework education, beta user support, workspace guidance

## Key Distinctions

### OVERSEER vs APEX Coordination
- **OVERSEER**: Internal coordination, workflow orchestration, resource management (Private ONLY)
- **APEX**: Beta coordination, framework education, user onboarding (Both Private & Public)

### Domain Expertise Areas
- **Technical**: ANALYST owns all technical architecture and development decisions
- **Infrastructure**: IRA owns all deployment, security, and operational infrastructure
- **Coordination**: Split between OVERSEER (private) and APEX (public-facing)
- **Documentation**: HISTORIAN owns knowledge preservation and documentation systems
- **Education**: APEX owns framework education and beta user experience

## Contextual Memory Implementation

Each agent will develop deep expertise in their domain using the 6-unit extraction program:
1. **Units 1-2**: Domain-specific decision extraction
2. **Units 3-4**: Context entry creation and evidence validation
3. **Units 5-6**: Relationship mapping and principle extraction

**Success Target**: 20+ domain-specific contexts with >95% query accuracy

## Installation Support

Each agent receives:
- Domain-specific templates and configuration
- Extraction keywords tailored to their expertise
- File pattern recognition for their technology stack
- Success criteria aligned with their role

*This profile system ensures each agent develops authentic domain expertise while maintaining clear boundaries between private and public operations.*
