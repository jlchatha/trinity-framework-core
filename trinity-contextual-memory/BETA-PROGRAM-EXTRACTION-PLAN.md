# Trinity Beta Program Contextual Extraction Plan

**Purpose**: Systematic extraction of beta program evolution decisions and wisdom  
**Source**: apex-beta/ and apex-beta-dev/ directories  
**Target**: 15-20 high-value context entries  

## Extraction Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture & Design Decisions (5 entries)
- [x] AWS Workspace choice rationale
- [x] Repository separation strategy  
- [ ] Checkpoint system design
- [ ] Template-based configuration approach
- [ ] npm global package handling decision

### Phase 2: Testing & Learning Evolution (5 entries)
- [ ] GitHub authentication pivot (SSH vs HTTPS)
- [ ] Direct download to full clone transition
- [ ] Claude CLI path resolution approach
- [ ] Error handling philosophy evolution
- [ ] Installation resilience improvements

### Phase 3: Monitoring & Privacy (3 entries)
- [x] Privacy-first monitoring philosophy
- [ ] Opt-in metrics collection design
- [ ] Separate monitoring component decision

### Phase 4: Future Roadmap Context (4 entries)
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration framework design
- [ ] Phased rollout strategy (1→2→3→4)
- [ ] Cloud-native evolution planning
- [ ] Enterprise integration approach

### Phase 5: Documentation Strategy (3 entries)
- [ ] User guide simplification approach
- [ ] Technical detail preservation
- [ ] Two-tier documentation system

## Extraction Methodology

### Step 1: Deep File Analysis
```bash
# Search for decision keywords in beta directories
grep -r "decided\|chose\|because\|reason\|why" apex-beta*/
grep -r "lesson\|learned\|mistake\|issue\|problem" apex-beta*/
grep -r "future\|roadmap\|plan\|phase" apex-beta*/
```

### Step 2: AAR Mining
```bash
# Find any AAR sessions in beta directories
find apex-beta* -name "*AAR*" -o -name "*aar*"
find apex-beta* -name "*retro*" -o -name "*lesson*"
```

### Step 3: Timeline Reconstruction
- Map commits and file creation dates
- Identify decision points and pivots
- Connect problems to solutions chronologically

### Step 4: Evidence Collection
- Extract specific quotes from documentation
- Capture code comments explaining choices
- Link to test results validating decisions

### Step 5: Context Entry Creation
For each identified decision:
1. Write clear Q&A format entry
2. Provide concrete evidence
3. Document impact and validation
4. Link to related contexts
5. Add to appropriate stream directory

## Priority Extraction Areas

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Installation Resilience Journey** - How checkpoint system evolved
2. **GitHub Authentication Pivot** - Why SSH over HTTPS
3. **Multi-Agent Framework** - Design rationale for agent handoffs

### Medium Priority (Next)
1. **Monitoring Component Separation** - Modular approach reasoning
2. **Template System Benefits** - Configuration management evolution
3. **Phased Rollout Strategy** - Why 4 phases, not continuous

### Low Priority (Future)
1. **Enterprise Integration Plans** - Future-proofing decisions
2. **Cloud-Native Evolution** - Scalability planning
3. **Documentation Tier System** - User vs developer split

## Success Metrics

- [ ] 15+ new context entries from beta program
- [ ] Coverage of all major architectural decisions
- [ ] Lessons learned properly documented
- [ ] Future roadmap context preserved
- [ ] All entries meet evidence standards

## Extraction Timeline

- **Unit 1-2**: Complete Phase 1 & 2 extractions
- **Unit 3-4**: Complete Phase 3 & 4 extractions  
- **Unit 5-6**: Complete Phase 5 and integration

## Tools & Queries

### Useful Ansible Queries After Extraction
```yaml
# Find all beta-related contexts
ansible-playbook ansible/context-query.yml -e "query='beta workspace aws'"

# Find monitoring decisions
ansible-playbook ansible/context-query.yml -e "query='privacy monitoring opt-in'"

# Find architecture choices
ansible-playbook ansible/context-query.yml -e "query='checkpoint resilience'"
```

## Quality Standards

Each extracted context must:
- Answer a specific "why" question
- Include concrete evidence (quotes, line numbers)
- Document real impact and outcomes
- Connect to 3+ related contexts
- Follow evidence-based format
