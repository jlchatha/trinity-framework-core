# Trinity Contextual Memory Expansion Guidelines

**Purpose**: Govern sustainable growth of Trinity's institutional memory  
**Philosophy**: "Quality scales, quantity doesn't. Deep expertise beats broad coverage."  
**Based on**: HISTORIAN's successful deep workspace extraction model  

## Expansion Principles

### 1. Agent-First Expansion
**Rule**: Only agents expand their own domains  
**Rationale**: Authentic expertise requires lived experience  
**Enforcement**: No agent documents another agent's decisions without explicit collaboration  

### 2. Domain Depth Before Cross-Domain Breadth
**Rule**: Agents must achieve 20+ contexts in their domain before expanding to other areas  
**Rationale**: Deep expertise provides more value than shallow coverage  
**Metrics**: Query accuracy >95% for domain questions before expansion allowed  

### 3. Evidence-Based Only
**Rule**: Every context entry must have concrete artifacts  
**Rationale**: Speculation degrades institutional memory quality  
**Standards**: Git commits, files, AAR sessions, measurable outcomes required  

### 4. Relationship Web Maintenance
**Rule**: New contexts must connect to existing decision webs  
**Rationale**: Isolated contexts provide limited value  
**Requirements**: 3+ "Related Context" links for each new entry  

## Agent Domain Boundaries

### HISTORIAN Domain (Established)
```yaml
primary_expertise:
  - documentation_architecture
  - knowledge_preservation_systems
  - recovery_protocols  
  - workflow_documentation
  - public_documentation_standards

context_coverage: 22 entries (6 HISTORIAN-specific)
query_accuracy: 100% for documentation domain
expansion_status: "Deep expertise achieved - template for others"
```

### ANALYST Domain (Next Priority)
```yaml

```

## Quality Gates

### Phase 1: Domain Extraction
- [ ] Agent identifies 15+ decisions requiring domain expertise
- [ ] Each decision backed by concrete artifacts
- [ ] Evidence trail clearly shows agent's specialist knowledge
- [ ] No generic decisions that any agent could make

### Phase 2: Context Creation
- [ ] 20+ context entries created following template standards
- [ ] Each entry demonstrates agent's unique value to Trinity
- [ ] Evidence quality passes validation criteria
- [ ] Related context mappings established

### Phase 3: Domain Authority
- [ ] Query system returns accurate agent-specific answers (>95%)
- [ ] Agent decision tree and principles documented
- [ ] 30+ relationship mappings between contexts
- [ ] Agent could train replacement using documented contexts

### Phase 4: Cross-Domain Integration
- [ ] Agent contexts connect to Trinity-wide patterns
- [ ] Cross-agent decision handoffs documented
- [ ] Collaborative contexts created for shared decisions
- [ ] No duplication or conflict with other agent domains

## Anti-Patterns and Prevention

### ❌ Scope Creep Prevention
**Risk**: Agents expanding beyond their expertise  
**Prevention**: Strict domain boundary enforcement  
**Detection**: Regular domain purity audits  
**Remediation**: Move misplaced contexts to correct agent domains  

### ❌ Quality Degradation Prevention
**Risk**: Lower evidence standards to increase count  
**Prevention**: Evidence validation at creation time  
**Detection**: Random quality sampling of contexts  
**Remediation**: Mandatory rework for substandard contexts  

### ❌ Relationship Web Fragmentation
**Risk**: Isolated contexts without connections  
**Prevention**: Mandatory relationship mapping for new contexts  
**Detection**: Automated relationship link validation  
**Remediation**: Required relationship additions before context approval  

### ❌ Duplication and Conflict
**Risk**: Multiple agents documenting same decisions  
**Prevention**: Clear decision ownership mapping  
**Detection**: Cross-agent decision conflict detection  
**Remediation**: Consolidation with primary agent ownership

---

**Strategic Vision**: By Phase 4, Trinity will have the deepest, most authentic institutional memory of any AI framework, with each agent functioning as a documented domain expert whose knowledge survives and transfers across contexts and time.

**Success Measure**: New Trinity team members can understand and contribute effectively within units rather than phases, thanks to comprehensive contextual memory spanning all agent domains.
