# Firefox Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Firefox still showing video issues after CloudFront deployment  
**Root Cause**: S3 bucket policy had wildcard in SourceArn condition  
**Solution**: Fixed bucket policy with specific distribution ARN  

## What Was Wrong

The initial S3 bucket policy used a wildcard:
```json
"AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::*:distribution/*"
```

This caused CloudFront to get 403 Forbidden errors when accessing S3.

## Fix Applied

Updated bucket policy with specific distribution ARN:
```json
"AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::644177601378:distribution/E37JIPKJ0LUYTT"
```

## Current Status

✅ **CloudFront**: Deployed and accessible  
✅ **Video Headers**: Proper `content-type: video/mp4`  
✅ **S3 Access**: 200 OK responses  
✅ **Firefox Ready**: Should now work properly  

## Test URLs

**Direct CloudFront**: https://d29tpqz2wgn380.cloudfront.net/OVERSEER_k3s.mp4  
**Firefox Test Page**: `/trinity-apex-video-hosting/firefox-test.html`  
**Production Site**: https://trinityapex.ai (Why Trinity section)  

## Verification Steps

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to https://trinityapex.ai
3. Scroll to "Watch OVERSEER Create a k3s Cluster" section
4. Video should play without "unsupported format" error

## Headers Now Returned

```
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: video/mp4
content-length: 22707328
cache-control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

The issue should now be resolved. Firefox will get proper video/mp4 content-type headers from CloudFront.
