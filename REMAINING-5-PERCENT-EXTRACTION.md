# Remaining 5% Workspace Context Extraction Plan

**Purpose**: Complete final contextual extraction from identified unexplored areas  
**Status**: Ready for Post-Compact Implementation  
**Coverage**: Complete remaining 95% â†’ 100% workspace knowledge capture  

## Identified Extraction Areas

### 1. Script Implementation Details (3 contexts)
- **memory-leak-fix.js**: Claude Code AbortSignal workaround approach
- **Embedded setup scripts**: Complete environment setup in wrapper scripts
- **Agent-specific variations**: Individual setup customizations and reasoning

### 2. Documentation Management System (2 contexts)
- **documentation-lifecycle.md**: Dual-repository management strategy
- **Cross-reference synchronization**: Version control for documentation

### 3. UI/UX Design Philosophy (2 contexts)
- **ShadowRun theme choice**: Dark cyberpunk aesthetic decision rationale
- **Animation decisions**: Glitch effects and visual identity choices

### 4. Operational Monitoring Scripts (3 contexts)
- **Cost optimization monitoring**: Zero-cost philosophy in action
- **Integrated monitoring design**: Dashboard and metrics approach
- **Performance tracking methodology**: Operational excellence patterns

### 5. Test Infrastructure Context (2 contexts)
- **Cross-platform testing evolution**: Linux vs macOS validation approach
- **Test data organization**: Memory hierarchy and recovery system testing

### 6. Hidden Development Artifacts (3 contexts)
- **Backup file patterns**: .bak and .orig files showing iteration
- **Temporary experiments**: /tmp workspace development insights
- **Git-ignored priorities**: What's excluded reveals values

## Extraction Methodology

### Evidence Sources
- Code comments explaining implementation choices
- Script headers documenting decision rationale
- CSS architecture revealing design evolution
- Test results showing validation approaches
- File naming patterns indicating priorities

### Context Entry Quality Standards
- Each context must answer specific "why" question
- Evidence must include concrete quotes/file references
- Impact must be documented with validation
- Related contexts must be cross-referenced
- Follow established evidence-based format

## Expected Outcomes

### Context Entries Target: 15 additional entries
- **Technical Stream**: 8 entries (implementation details, UI/UX, testing)
- **Operational Stream**: 5 entries (monitoring, management, workflows)
- **Cultural Stream**: 2 entries (aesthetic choices, development philosophy)

### Final Trinity Contextual Memory Statistics
- **Total Entries**: 67 (52 current + 15 remaining)
- **Workspace Coverage**: 100% comprehensive
- **Query Accuracy Target**: Maintain 100%
- **Cross-References**: 60+ relationship links

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Implementation-critical)
1. Memory leak fix context
2. Documentation lifecycle system
3. Monitoring philosophy contexts

### Medium Priority (Pattern-completing)
1. UI/UX design decisions
2. Test infrastructure evolution
3. Script embedding rationale

### Low Priority (Historical completeness)
1. Development artifact patterns
2. Temporary experiment insights
3. Backup file evolution

## Post-Compact Success Criteria

- [ ] All 15 contexts extracted with evidence
- [ ] 100% workspace coverage achieved
- [ ] INDEX.md updated with new entries
- [ ] Query system validates all new contexts
- [ ] Cross-reference web maintains integrity
- [ ] Final AAR session documents completion

## Integration with Existing Knowledge

These final contexts will:
- Complete implementation decision coverage
- Reveal final design philosophy elements
- Document operational excellence patterns
- Preserve development evolution insights
- Provide comprehensive Trinity knowledge base
