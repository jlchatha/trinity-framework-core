# AAR Session: Firefox Video Playback - Ongoing Issue

**Date**: June 29, 2025  
**Agent**: HISTORIAN  
**Status**: PARTIAL - Issue continues post-codec fix  
**Context**: Firefox MIME error resurfaces on play button click  

## What Happened

Despite successful AWS CloudFront deployment and codec specification fix:
1. Firefox shows video player (progress from initial MIME error)
2. Codec specification allows Firefox to recognize format
3. But when play button clicked, MIME error returns
4. Works perfectly in Chrome/Edge browsers

## What Worked

### AWS Infrastructure Success:
- ✅ CloudFront CDN deployed and serving video
- ✅ Budget protection with Lambda auto-shutoff
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard operational
- ✅ Email alerts to apex@trinity-apex.com configured
- ✅ S3 bucket policy correctly configured

### Partial Firefox Progress:
- ✅ Video player appears (no immediate MIME error)
- ✅ Codec specification recognized by Firefox
- ✅ Debug test confirmed codec version displays player

## What Didn't Work

### Firefox Playback:
- ❌ MIME error returns when play button clicked
- ❌ Video won't actually stream in Firefox
- ❌ Codec specification insufficient for full compatibility

## Root Cause Analysis

Firefox appears to have a two-stage validation:
1. **Initial Load**: Checks codec specification (now passes)
2. **Play Attempt**: Deeper format validation (still fails)

Likely causes:
- MP4 encoding not fully Firefox-compatible
- Firefox requires specific H.264 profile/level
- CloudFront headers not sufficient for Firefox streaming

## Recommended Solutions (Post-Compact)

### Option 1: WebM Conversion (Recommended)
```bash
ffmpeg -i OVERSEER_k3s.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus OVERSEER_k3s.webm
```
- Upload WebM to S3
- Add as primary source for Firefox
- Keep MP4 for other browsers

### Option 2: YouTube Unlisted
- Upload to YouTube as unlisted
- Replace video element with iframe
- Universal compatibility guaranteed
- Less professional but works immediately

### Option 3: Re-encode MP4
- Use Firefox-friendly H.264 baseline profile
- Ensure proper encoding parameters
- May resolve without format change

## Current Workaround

Users can:
1. Use Chrome/Edge browsers (fully working)
2. Download video via fallback button
3. View on Trinity Framework 2.0 site

## Lessons Learned

1. **Firefox video compatibility is complex** - Not just MIME types and codecs
2. **Test actual playback** - Player appearance doesn't guarantee functionality
3. **WebM is Firefox-preferred** - MP4 support varies by encoding
4. **Progressive enhancement critical** - Always have download fallback

## Next Actions

1. **Post-compact priority**: Convert to WebM format
2. **Test WebM in all browsers** before deployment
3. **Consider dual format strategy** (WebM + MP4)
4. **Document Firefox requirements** for future videos

## Impact

- **Business**: Video demo works in 80%+ of browsers
- **Technical**: AWS infrastructure fully operational
- **User Experience**: Firefox users need workaround
- **Timeline**: Full fix deferred to post-compact

*AWS video hosting infrastructure successful, Firefox format compatibility requires additional work post-compact.*
