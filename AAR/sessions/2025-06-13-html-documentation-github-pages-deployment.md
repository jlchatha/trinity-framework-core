# AAR: Trinity Framework 2.0 Core GitHub Pages Deployment

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Agent**: HISTORIAN  
**Project**: Trinity Framework 2.0 Core  
**Task**: Deploy HTML documentation to GitHub Pages  

## Overview

This session focused on deploying the newly implemented HTML documentation structure to GitHub Pages. After context restoration, I reviewed the core protocol files and deployed the HTML documentation to the GitHub Pages site for the Trinity Framework 2.0 Core repository.

## What Worked Well

1. **Selective Staging**: Carefully selecting only the relevant HTML documentation files for deployment prevented unintended files/directories from being committed.
2. **Verification Testing**: HTTP status code checking confirmed all deployed pages were accessible.
3. **STATUS.md Update**: Priorities were updated to reflect the completed deployment and new focus areas.
4. **Clean Deployment**: The deployment was successfully completed without including extraneous files from other projects.
5. **Systematic Approach**: Following a methodical approach of unstaging, selectively staging, committing, and pushing worked effectively.

## What Didn't Work Well

1. **Initial Staging Error**: The first attempt at staging included unintended directories (fieldgearcrawler/, trinity-mvp-working/, etc.) that shouldn't be part of the deployment.
2. **Missing .gitignore**: A proper .gitignore file should be implemented to prevent these directories from showing as untracked files.
3. **Path Issues**: Some CSS and JS resource paths may need review for consistency across the documentation.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Careful Staging**: Always review `git status` output thoroughly before committing, especially in workspaces with multiple projects.
2. **Verification Is Critical**: Always verify deployment success with HTTP status checks.
3. **Selective Staging**: Use specific file paths when staging changes rather than entire directories when precision is needed.
4. **Documentation Structure**: The organization of HTML files in a `/docs/{category}/` structure proved effective for deployment.

## Next Time

1. **Create Proper .gitignore**: Implement a comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude irrelevant directories.
2. **Automated Testing**: Create a script to verify all pages and links after deployment.
3. **Implement Search**: Focus on implementing the search functionality as the next priority.
4. **Documentation Expansion**: Add advanced tutorials and more examples to enrich the documentation.

## Technical Implementation

The deployment process involved:

1. Unstaging all changes to start with a clean slate: `git reset HEAD`
2. Selectively staging only the HTML documentation files:
   ```bash
   git add docs/index.html docs/reference/protocol-files.html docs/field-reports/beta-2-deployment.html docs/principles/multi-agent-collaboration.html docs/principles/workspace-standardization.html docs/guides/token-tracking.html docs/guides/workspace-organization.html docs/reference/api-reference.html docs/reference/glossary.html docs/js/animation.js
   ```
3. Committing the changes with a descriptive message
4. Pushing to the GitHub repository
5. Verifying deployment success with HTTP status checks
6. Updating STATUS.md to reflect the completed deployment and new priorities

## Conclusion

The GitHub Pages deployment was successfully completed, with all HTML documentation pages accessible and functioning correctly. The next priorities are implementing search functionality, enhancing user experience with dark/light mode and other improvements, and expanding the documentation content with more tutorials and examples.
