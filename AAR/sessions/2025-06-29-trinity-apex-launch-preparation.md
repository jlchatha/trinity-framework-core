# AAR Session: Trinity Apex Website Launch Preparation

**Date**: June 29, 2025  
**Agent**: HISTORIAN  
**Status**: COMPLETE - Ready for weekend launch  
**Context**: Final preparation and Firefox video troubleshooting  

## What Happened

Completed all critical launch tasks for Trinity Apex website:
1. Activated Formspree contact form with provided ID
2. Added Justin's LinkedIn photo from workspace
3. Debugged video playback issue - works in Edge, not Firefox
4. Applied multiple fixes for Firefox compatibility
5. Created fallback download option for video

## What Worked

- **Quick Formspree Integration**: Simple form ID replacement
- **Photo Addition**: Found in `/img/jlinkedin.jpg`, copied successfully
- **Custom Domain Discovery**: Site uses trinityapex.ai, not GitHub subdomain
- **Fallback Strategy**: Download button ensures video accessibility

## What Didn't Work

- **Firefox Video Playback**: Persistent MIME type errors despite:
  - Adding codec specifications
  - Using GitHub raw URLs
  - Multiple source tags
  - Different URL formats

## Lessons Learned

1. **Browser Differences**: Firefox has much stricter video requirements than Chrome/Edge
2. **Custom Domain Impact**: Affects all asset paths and baseurl configuration
3. **GitHub Pages Limitations**: May have restrictions on video streaming
4. **Fallback Importance**: Always provide download option for media

## Technical Details

### Video Attempts:
1. Local path with baseurl
2. GitHub raw.githubusercontent.com
3. GitHub.com/raw format
4. Explicit codec declarations
5. iframe embedding from Framework site

### Firefox Error:
"No video with supported format and MIME type found"

## Next Time

1. **Test in Multiple Browsers Early**: Don't assume cross-browser compatibility
2. **Consider CDN from Start**: YouTube/Vimeo for guaranteed compatibility
3. **WebM Format**: Firefox prefers WebM over MP4
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with simple, add complexity

## Alternative Solutions Identified

1. **YouTube**: Upload as unlisted, embed iframe
2. **Vimeo**: Professional appearance, better privacy
3. **Format Conversion**: Convert to WebM using FFmpeg
4. **Video CDN**: Cloudflare Stream, Bunny.net

## Current Status

- Website fully functional and launch-ready
- All critical features working
- Video has download fallback for Firefox
- Ready for weekend launch
- Alternative video solutions documented for post-launch
