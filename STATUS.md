## Notes for Human

I've enhanced the authentication deployment solution and updated documentation for the FieldGearCrawler project. Here's a comprehensive summary of the current status and next steps:

**Completed Work**:
- Authentication UI components implemented and integrated with AWS Cognito
- Deploy-to-amplify.sh script created to automate deployment process
- Fixed Next.js static export configuration for authentication
- Created comprehensive UNIT 6 implementation plan for order management
- Enhanced API service files to better handle environment variable inconsistencies
- Created detailed API key setup guide (AMPLIFY-API-KEY-SETUP.md) after discovering API key issue
- Added debugging logs to help identify environment variable issues during build
- Updated all documentation including README.md with build status badges
- Created AAR document capturing implementation details and lessons learned

**Deployment Status**:
- Initial deployments (21-25) failed due to environment variable and API key issues
- API key has been created in API Gateway and configured in Amplify environment variables
- Environment variable handling has been improved in code to support both naming conventions
- A new deployment is being prepared with simplified environment variable handling

**Current Issues**:
- Inconsistent environment variable naming (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT`)
- API key integration with frontend code needs refinement
- Build process may not be correctly incorporating environment variables

**Next Steps After Compact**:
1. Verify API key is correctly associated with usage plan in API Gateway
2. Ensure both `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT` are set with the same value
3. Simplify environment variable handling to reduce complexity
4. Trigger a new deployment in AWS Amplify
5. Verify successful deployment and authentication flow
6. Begin implementation of order management system per UNIT 6 plan

All core files have been updated and the project is ready for compact. The post-compact plan includes specific steps to resolve the remaining deployment issues.

All core files have been updated and the project is ready for compact. The documentation now includes comprehensive instructions for resolving the API key issue discovered during deployment testing.
