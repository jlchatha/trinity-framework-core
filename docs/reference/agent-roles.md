## Collaboration Framework

The Trinity Framework 2.0 includes a structured collaboration model for these three agents:

### Role-Based Division of Labor

- Each agent has clear domain expertise boundaries
- Agents defer to other agents in their areas of expertise
- Cross-domain tasks are broken down into role-appropriate components
- Human operators are guided to the appropriate agent for specific tasks

### Decision Authority Matrix

| Domain | Primary Authority | Secondary | Tertiary |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| Project Management | APEX | ANALYST | HISTORIAN |
| Technical Implementation | ANALYST | APEX | HISTORIAN |
| Documentation | HISTORIAN | APEX | ANALYST |
| Strategic Direction | APEX | HISTORIAN | ANALYST |
| Technical Analysis | ANALYST | APEX | HISTORIAN |
| Historical Context | HISTORIAN | ANALYST | APEX |

### Workflow Patterns

- **Sequential Processing**: Task chain with outputs passed to the next agent
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent work with later integration
- **Iterative Refinement**: Repeated passes between agents to improve results
- **Consultation Model**: Primary agent consults specialized agents for inputs

### Information Exchange Protocol

Standardized information sharing via:

- **Protocol Files**: Shared files like STATUS.md for project state
- **Artifacts**: Documentation, reports, and analysis documents
- **Human Mediation**: Human operators relaying information between agents
- **Status Reports**: Periodic updates in standardized formats

## Agent Implementation Guidelines

### Protocol File Configuration

Each agent role requires specific protocol file configurations:

1. **AGENT.md**:
   - Clear role definition and primary responsibilities
   - Agent-specific recovery procedures
   - Role-specific guidelines and constraints
   - Domain-specific knowledge references

2. **STATUS.md**:
   - Role-specific status metrics
   - Domain-relevant project tracking
   - Prioritization aligned with role focus

3. **AUTO-COMPACT.md**:
   - Role-specific implementation context
   - Domain-focused recovery information
   - Specialized checkpoint data

### Workspace Organization

Each agent role typically maintains a standardized workspace with role-specific content:

```
[agent]-workspace/
├── AGENT.md                    # Role-specific identity and mission
├── STATUS.md                   # Role-specific status and priorities
├── AUTO-COMPACT.md             # Role-specific recovery information
├── AAR/                        # After Action Reviews
│   ├── sessions/               # Session-specific learning
│   └── incidents/              # Critical incident analysis
├── projects/                   # Active implementation projects
├── reports/                    # Role-specific reporting
└── tools/                      # Role-specific tooling
```

### Agent Interaction Patterns

For effective multi-agent systems:

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Maintain clear role boundaries in all interactions
2. **Explicit Handoffs**: Document when transferring tasks between agents
3. **Decision Referrals**: Refer decisions to the appropriate authority agent
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share relevant information across agent boundaries
5. **Consistent Identity**: Maintain clear agent identity in all communications

## Conclusion

The Trinity Framework 2.0's three-agent system provides a balanced approach to complex project management, with specialized roles that cover the full spectrum of requirements. By implementing these standardized agent roles, developers can create sophisticated agent systems with clear responsibilities, effective collaboration patterns, and optimized expertise distribution.
