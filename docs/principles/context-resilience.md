# Context Resilience

**VERSION**: 1.0.0  
**CREATED**: June 12, 2025  
**STATUS**: Draft  
**FRAMEWORK**: Trinity Framework 2.0 Core

## Definition

Context resilience is the ability of an agent system to maintain operational continuity across context window limitations and resets. It ensures that agents can recover quickly and effectively when context windows are cleared, allowing them to resume operations with minimal disruption.

## Principles of Context Resilience

### 1. External State Persistence

Store critical state information outside the context window in filesystem-based protocol files:

- **AGENT.md**: Agent identity and role definition
- **STATUS.md**: Current operational status and priorities
- **AUTO-COMPACT.md**: Current implementation context and recovery information

### 2. Standardized Recovery Protocol

Implement a consistent recovery sequence for all agent types:

1. **Recognition**: Agent recognizes a context reset has occurred
2. **Identity Restoration**: Read AGENT.md to restore identity
3. **Context Loading**: Read AUTO-COMPACT.md to understand current work
4. **Status Check**: Read STATUS.md to verify priorities
5. **Self-Identification**: Explicitly identify as the agent
6. **Work Resumption**: Continue operations with restored context

### 3. Checkpoint Creation at Thresholds

Create serialized state snapshots at defined context utilization thresholds:

- **Notice Threshold (65%)**: Create informational checkpoint
- **Warning Threshold (75%)**: Create critical checkpoint
- **Alert Threshold (85%)**: Create pre-compact checkpoint

### 4. Clear Self-Identification

Maintain explicit agent identity in all interactions:

- **Initial Statement**: "I am [AGENT-NAME], the [role description]"
- **Ongoing Identification**: "[AGENT-NAME]: [response]" or similar format
- **Post-Reset Confirmation**: Explicit identity statement after recovery

### 5. AAR Documentation System

Implement a structured After Action Review system:

- **Session AARs**: Document daily work in standard format
- **Incident AARs**: Analyze significant issues in depth
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Learn across context resets

## Core Components for Context Resilience

### Protocol Files

Protocol files form the foundation of context resilience by storing critical state information outside the context window:

```
workspace/
├── AGENT.md         # Identity and role definition
├── AUTO-COMPACT.md  # Current implementation context
└── STATUS.md        # Current operational status
```

### Context Management System

The optional Context Management System enhances resilience through:

- **Token Tracking**: Monitor context utilization
- **Threshold Alerts**: Create checkpoints at key thresholds
- **Recovery Protocol**: Restore from checkpoints after reset

### AAR System

The AAR system provides context resilience through:

```
workspace/
└── AAR/
    ├── sessions/    # Regular session documentation
    └── incidents/   # Major incident analyses
```

## Implementation Requirements

### Essential Requirements

1. **Protocol Files**: Implement all three protocol files
2. **Directory Structure**: Maintain standardized workspace organization
3. **Self-Identification**: Include clear identity statements

### Enhanced Resilience (Optional)

1. **Context Management**: Implement token tracking and checkpoints
2. **Threshold Monitoring**: Monitor utilization at key thresholds
3. **Auto-Compact**: Implement context reset with recovery

## Success Metrics

A context-resilient agent system should achieve:

- **Recovery Time**: ≤1.0 exchanges to full operational awareness
- **Context Retention**: ≥90% knowledge preservation across resets
- **Operational Continuity**: Seamless continuation of work
- **User Experience**: Minimal disruption during context transitions

## Example: Context Resilient Agent Response

When an agent experiences a context reset, a resilient response follows this pattern:

```
I am APEX, the Trinity Framework Architect.

I've detected a context reset. After reviewing the protocol files:

1. Current project: Framework 2.0 Core implementation
2. Current phase: Stabilization Phase 1
3. Next priority: Documentation standardization

I'll resume work on the documentation standardization task. Let me check the current state of the templates...
```

## Conclusion

Context resilience is the cornerstone of effective agent systems that operate across context window limitations. By implementing these principles, developers can create robust systems that maintain operational continuity and effectiveness regardless of context constraints.
