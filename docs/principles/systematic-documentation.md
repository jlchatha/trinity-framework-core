# Systematic Documentation

**VERSION**: 1.0.0  
**CREATED**: June 12, 2025  
**STATUS**: Draft  
**FRAMEWORK**: Trinity Framework 2.0 Core

---

## Definition

Systematic documentation is the practice of creating, organizing, and maintaining documentation in standardized formats and locations to ensure information accessibility across context resets. This principle is critical for context resilience and operational continuity in agent systems.

> **Note**: Additional details about this principle can be found in the comprehensive [Framework Core Principles](../FRAMEWORK-CORE-PRINCIPLES.md) document.

## Key Components

### AAR (After Action Review) System

A structured two-tier documentation system:

- **Session AARs**: Document regular work sessions (20-50 lines)
- **Incident AARs**: Document major incidents in depth (100+ lines)
- **Location**: `/AAR/sessions/` and `/AAR/incidents/` directories

### Standardized Documentation Formats

Consistent document structures across the framework:

- **Protocol Files**: Standard sections and content requirements
- **AAR Documents**: Templated format with standard sections
- **Project Documentation**: Consistent organization and headings
- **Status Reports**: Standard metrics and reporting formats

### Implementation Details in Dedicated Locations

Clear separation of different documentation types:

- **Protocol Files**: Workspace root directory
- **Project Documentation**: Within project directories
- **System Documentation**: In appropriate categorized locations
- **Recovery Documentation**: In protocol files and AAR documents

### Recovery-Oriented Knowledge Organization

Documentation organized to facilitate context recovery:

- **Chronological Organization**: Date-based session AARs
- **Topic-Based Organization**: Categorized documentation
- **Priority-Based Organization**: Critical information first
- **Cross-Referenced Organization**: Linked documentation

## Implementation Requirements

### AAR Sessions for Continuous Learning

Regular documentation of work sessions:

```
/AAR/
├── sessions/
│   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
│   └── ...
└── incidents/
    ├── DESCRIPTIVE-NAME-RCA.md
    └── ...
```

### Documentation Templates for Consistency

Standardized templates for all documentation types:

- Session AAR template with standard sections
- Incident AAR template with detailed analysis format
- Project documentation templates
- Status report templates

### Version Control of Critical Documents

Tracking changes to important documentation:

- Dated protocol file updates
- Change logs for critical documentation
- Versioning of templates
- Historical records of significant changes

### Documentation Health Metrics

Measuring documentation quality and coverage:

- **Completeness**: Percentage of required documentation
- **Currency**: Time since last update
- **Clarity**: Readability and accessibility
- **Recovery Value**: Effectiveness during context reset

## Documentation Workflow

### Session Documentation

1. **Create**: After each significant work session
2. **Format**: Using the session AAR template
3. **Store**: In `/AAR/sessions/` with date-based filename
4. **Reference**: During context recovery and planning

### Incident Documentation

1. **Create**: After major incidents or challenges
2. **Format**: Using the incident AAR template
3. **Store**: In `/AAR/incidents/` with descriptive filename
4. **Reference**: When facing similar challenges

### Protocol File Updates

1. **Review**: After completing major tasks
2. **Update**: Reflect current status and priorities
3. **Verify**: Ensure recovery instructions are current
4. **Document**: Note the update in STATUS.md

## Example Implementation

### Session AAR Template

```markdown
# Session: YYYY-MM-DD Description

## Activities Completed
- [List of completed activities]

## Challenges Encountered
- [List of challenges and how they were addressed]

## Key Insights
- [Important insights gained during the session]

## Lessons Learned
- [What worked well and what didn't]

## Next Actions
- [Actions to take in the next session]
```

### Incident AAR Template

```markdown
# Incident: Descriptive Name

## Overview
Brief description of the incident

## Timeline
- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM**: Initial detection
- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM**: Key event 1
- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM**: Key event 2
- **YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM**: Resolution

## Root Cause Analysis
Detailed analysis of what caused the incident

## Resolution
How the incident was resolved

## Impact
What systems or operations were affected

## Prevention
Measures to prevent similar incidents

## Technical Details
Detailed technical information, code, logs, etc.
```

## Best Practices

### Consistency

- Use standardized templates for all documentation
- Follow naming conventions consistently
- Maintain standard sections and formats
- Use consistent terminology

### Accessibility

- Store documentation in predictable locations
- Organize documentation for easy retrieval
- Use clear, concise language
- Structure content for quick understanding

### Completeness

- Document all significant work sessions
- Analyze and document all major incidents
- Include both successes and challenges
- Capture lessons learned and next steps

### Recovery Focus

- Prioritize information needed during recovery
- Include context restoration instructions
- Document current state and priorities
- Reference related documentation

## Conclusion

Systematic documentation is a foundational principle of Trinity Framework 2.0 Core that enables context resilience and continuous improvement. By implementing standardized documentation formats, locations, and practices, agent systems can maintain operational continuity across context limitations and learn effectively from past experiences.
