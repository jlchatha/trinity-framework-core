# Post-Compact Instructions

## Immediate Post-Compact Tasks

1. **Verify Core Protocol Files**
   - Ensure AGENT.md, STATUS.md, and AUTO-COMPACT.md are present and correctly formatted
   - Check context health metrics and update if necessary
   - Verify recovery from any available checkpoints

2. **Review HTML Directory Structure Issues**
   - Analyze what went wrong with the previous HTML directory structure push
   - Identify potential file path or permission issues
   - Plan a clean implementation approach

3. **Implement Clean HTML Directory Structure**
   - Create a separate HTML directory with proper organization
   - Implement consistent navigation across all pages
   - Ensure all internal links work correctly
   - Avoid mixing with existing repository structure

4. **Create Missing Documentation Pages**
   - Create protocol-files.html in reference directory
   - Create multi-agent-collaboration.html in principles directory
   - Create workspace-organization.html in guides directory
   - Create token-tracking.html in guides directory
   - Create api-reference.html in reference directory
   - Create glossary.html in reference directory

5. **Implement Consistent Navigation**
   - Add sidebar to all pages with complete navigation
   - Add breadcrumb navigation for improved user experience
   - Ensure active page is highlighted in navigation
   - Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes

6. **Verify GitHub Pages Deployment**
   - Push changes to the repository
   - Check that GitHub Pages is correctly displaying the updated structure
   - Verify all links work in the deployed version
   - Test on different devices and screen sizes

## Notes on HTML Directory Structure

The previous attempt to push the HTML directory structure encountered issues, possibly due to:
1. File paths or permissions problems
2. Conflicts with existing repository structure
3. Large number of files pushed simultaneously
4. Potential GitHub repository configuration issues

For the next implementation:
1. Create a cleaner, more focused directory structure
2. Push changes incrementally rather than all at once
3. Separate HTML documentation from existing content
4. Test locally before pushing to GitHub

## Expected Outcome

A complete, well-organized HTML documentation structure with:
1. Consistent navigation across all pages
2. Comprehensive content covering all aspects of Trinity Framework 2.0 Core
3. ShadowRun-inspired theme with responsive design
4. Proper deployment on GitHub Pages
