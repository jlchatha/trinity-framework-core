# Formspree Email Notification Setup

## Issue
Submissions are being received by Formspree (confirmed via API test) but email notifications aren't being sent to apex@trinity-apex.com.

## Checklist to Fix

1. **Log into Formspree Dashboard**
   - Go to https://formspree.io/forms/xdkzyrqo/settings

2. **Check Email Settings**
   - Click on "Email Notifications" tab
   - Ensure "Email me on new submissions" is ON
   - Verify email is set to: apex@trinity-apex.com
   - Check if email is verified (green checkmark)

3. **Check Form Status**
   - Ensure form is "Active" not "Inactive"
   - Check if there's a warning about email verification

4. **Check Plan Limits**
   - Free plan might have email notification limits
   - Check if you've hit submission limits

5. **Alternative: Use Webhooks**
   If email notifications aren't working, we can:
   - Set up a webhook to notify us
   - Poll the Formspree API directly
   - Use their dashboard to check manually
