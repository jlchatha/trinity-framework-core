# Formspree Email Fix Steps

## Most Likely Issues:

### 1. **CHECK FORM RULES** (Most Common)
- Go to: https://formspree.io/forms/xdkzyrqo/rules
- **If you have ANY rules**, they override the default email!
- Either:
  - Delete all rules to use default email, OR
  - Add a rule with:
    - Condition: "Always"
    - Action: "Send Email"
    - To: apex@trinity-apex.com

### 2. **Unblock Email**
Visit this URL to unblock the email:
https://formspree.io/unblock/apex@trinity-apex.com

### 3. **Check Gmail Quarantine**
Since you're using Gmail (not Outlook), also check:
- All Mail folder
- Important folder
- Promotions tab
- Updates tab

## Quick Test After Fix:

```bash
# Submit another test
curl -X POST https://formspree.io/f/xdkzyrqo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "name=Fix Test&email=test@test.com&plan=byoc&project=Testing after fix"
```
