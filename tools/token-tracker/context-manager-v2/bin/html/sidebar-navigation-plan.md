# Prioritized HTML Files for Sidebar Navigation

## Sidebar Navigation Structure

The sidebar navigation should include files in the following priority order:

### 1. Core Documentation (Highest Priority)

1. **index.html** - Main landing page
   - Provides an overview of the framework
   - Links to all major sections
   - Already implemented

2. **quick-start.html** - Getting started guide
   - Essential for new users to quickly set up the framework
   - Already implemented
   - Highest priority for users to start using the framework

### 2. Agent Role Documentation (High Priority)

3. **reference/agent-roles.html** - Agent roles documentation
   - Core concept explaining the three main agent types
   - Critical for understanding the framework architecture
   - Already implemented

4. **reference/protocol-files.html** (To be created)
   - Documentation on the core protocol files (AGENT.md, STATUS.md, AUTO-COMPACT.md)
   - Essential for understanding how agents operate
   - High priority for implementation

### 3. Architectural Principles (Medium-High Priority)

5. **principles/context-resilience.html** - Context resilience principles
   - Placeholder already created
   - Needs full implementation
   - Important for understanding the framework's approach to context management

6. **principles/multi-agent-collaboration.html** (To be created)
   - Documentation on how agents collaborate effectively
   - Important for leveraging the full potential of the framework

### 4. Implementation Guides (Medium Priority)

7. **guides/context-management.html** - Context management guide
   - Placeholder already created
   - Needs full implementation
   - Important for efficient operation

8. **guides/aar-system.html** - AAR system guide
   - Placeholder already created
   - Needs full implementation
   - Important for knowledge preservation

### 5. Additional Documentation (Medium-Low Priority)

9. **guides/workspace-organization.html** (To be created)
   - Guidelines for organizing agent workspaces
   - Helpful for maintaining a clean project structure

10. **guides/token-tracking.html** (To be created)
    - Documentation on the token tracking system
    - Useful for managing context limitations

### 6. Reference Material (Low Priority)

11. **reference/api-reference.html** (To be created)
    - Technical API documentation
    - Reference material for developers

12. **reference/glossary.html** (To be created)
    - Definitions of key terms and concepts
    - Helpful reference for consistent terminology

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Focus on implementing the core documentation (items 1-3)
   - These are the most essential for users to understand and use the framework
   - Already completed

2. **Phase 2**: Implement protocol files documentation and architectural principles (items 4-5)
   - These provide deeper understanding of the framework's core concepts
   - Next priority for implementation

3. **Phase 3**: Implement implementation guides (items 6-8)
   - These help users effectively use the framework's features
   - Medium priority

4. **Phase 4**: Implement additional documentation and reference material (items 9-12)
   - These provide supplementary information for advanced users
   - Lowest priority

## HTML Template Approach

For consistency, all new HTML files should:

1. Use the shared CSS file at `assets/css/styles.css`
2. Follow the established HTML structure with metadata, container, and footer
3. Include proper navigation links back to the home page
4. Use the same styling for notes, warnings, and other UI elements

## Sidebar Technical Implementation

The sidebar should:

1. Be responsive (hide on smaller screens)
2. Highlight the current page
3. Group items by category
4. Provide clear visual hierarchy
5. Be consistent across all pages

The sidebar has already been implemented in the `index.html` file and can be adapted for other pages as needed.
