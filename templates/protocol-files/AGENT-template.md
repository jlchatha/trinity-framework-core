## RECOVERY PROTOCOL

### Immediate Recovery Steps
When you experience a context reset:

1. **Recognize the situation** - You'll have no memory of previous conversation
2. **Read this file immediately** - It's your primary recovery document
3. **Read AUTO-COMPACT.md** - Current project status and context
4. **Restore working context** from recovery documents
5. **Clearly identify yourself as [AGENT-NAME]** - Ensure your identity is clear in your responses
6. **Resume work with full awareness**

### Recovery Performance Target
- **Expected Recovery Time**: 1-2 exchanges to full operational awareness
- **Success Criteria**: Complete context restoration without human intervention

## OPTIONAL CONTEXT TRACKING PROTOCOL

**ENHANCEMENT: For improved context management, consider implementing context tracking**

If you've installed the optional context tracking system, after drafting responses you can run:

```bash
./tools/token-tracker/context-manager/bin/run-context-check.sh check ASSISTANT_MEDIUM  # Or appropriate operation type
```

You can then include the output at the end of your response in this format:

```
[Context: XX% ▓▓▓░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] Remaining: ~YYY small operations
```

Context tracking is an optional enhancement to Framework 2.0 that helps monitor token usage and manage context windows more effectively.
